"""
This module is responsible for taking given data points
and applying it to the data capture.

It will also create an email with text and files auto-attached,
but will not send the email so that the user can check the email before sending.

The primary way of applying data is using pyautogui
to control the mouse and keyboard.
"""

# import pyautogui

# Temp code - get XY coordinates of the mouse
# pos = pyautogui.position()
