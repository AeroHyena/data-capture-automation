# data-capture-automation
This app automates the data capture process to increase accuracy and data reliability.


The following process is used:

-> Extract text from document file

-> Filter text to extract needed data points.

-> Commit data points to a database

-> Provide a gui that a user can use to accessa and edit data from said database.


## Changes
- The last major commit added data filtering to extract data points.
- The next major commit will add the ability to store and retrieve data from a database.
