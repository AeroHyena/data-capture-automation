# data-capture-automation
This app automates the data capture process to increase accuracy and data reliability.


The following process is used:

-> Extract text from document file

-> Filter text to eliminate unneccessary information.

-> Navigate to the data capture window

-> Copy and paste data points into their respective fields



This process uses a user-prespective approach to eliminate the need to access external databases, especially since this is intended to be a temporary solution.
